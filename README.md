# Pocket Calculator

A simple calculator web applet written in Javascript, as part of a [FreeCodeCamp challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). In addition to doing calculations, this applet also has a few cosmetic touches, such as mimicking losing power when covering the solar array with your "hand", and mimicking the polarizing effect you get when you press against a calculator's LCD screen.

[A running version of this code can be found on Codepen](https://codepen.io/Ashto/pen/VzMQWZ).
